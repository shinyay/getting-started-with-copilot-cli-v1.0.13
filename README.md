## Description

**GitHub Copilot CLI** is a terminal-based **AI agent** that lets you have conversations while reading your codebase, editing files, and executing commands — all with approval steps in between. Beyond simple Q&A, Copilot CLI enables a complete **plan → execute → verify (test/build) → diff review** workflow entirely within the terminal. ([Docs][2])

### Key Characteristics

- Works across **Linux / macOS / Windows** (PowerShell / WSL). ([Docs][3])
- Three operating modes: **Interactive**, **Plan**, and **Autopilot** — plus a **Programmatic** interface (`-p`). ([Docs][3])
- Editor-agnostic — edit in the terminal, confirm in any editor. ([Features][6])
- Integrates with **GitHub Issues and PRs** for end-to-end workflows. ([Docs][3])
- Extensible via **MCP servers**, **custom agents**, **skills**, and **plugins**. ([Docs][2])

---

## Requirement

- **Valid GitHub Copilot subscription** (Individual, Business, or Enterprise). ([Docs][1])
- **Node.js 22+** (if installing via npm). ([Docs][1])
- **PowerShell v6+** (Windows). ([Docs][1])
- Organization admins must **not have disabled** Copilot CLI for the org. ([Docs][1])

---

## Installation

### npm (All Platforms — Requires Node.js 22+)

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

### Windows (WinGet)

```powershell
winget install GitHub.Copilot
```

### macOS / Linux (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install copilot-cli
```

### macOS / Linux (Install Script)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

The script supports `PREFIX` and `VERSION` environment variables for pinning specific versions. ([Docs][1])

### Via GitHub CLI

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-copilot
gh copilot
```

> ⚠️ This installs the **`gh copilot` extension** — a different tool from the standalone `copilot` CLI. For the full agent experience, use one of the installation methods above.

([Docs][3])

### Download from GitHub.com

Download executables directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases/). Unpack and run the executable for your platform.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install** Copilot CLI (see [Installation](#installation) above).

2. **Navigate** to your target repository and launch:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   copilot
   ```
   ([Docs][2])

3. **Trust the folder** — Copilot will ask whether to trust the current directory since it may read, modify, and execute files within it. Options: ([Docs][2])
   - **Yes, proceed** — trust for this session only
   - **Yes, and remember this folder** — trust for this and future sessions
   - **No, exit (Esc)** — end the session

4. **Authenticate** — if not already logged in, run `/login`. ([Docs][1])
   - Alternatively, set a **fine-grained PAT** with the **"Copilot requests"** permission via `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`. ([Docs][1])

5. **Try your first prompt:**
   ```
   What does this repository contain?
   ```

You're now ready to follow the Learning Path below.

## 🎓 Learning Path

This learning path is designed to take you from zero to productive with Copilot CLI. Work through each level in order — each one builds on skills from the previous level.

### Level 1: Observe — Read-Only Exploration (No Risk)

**Goal:** Get comfortable with the interactive UI and learn how Copilot reads your codebase. Nothing is modified at this level.

> 📂 Full workshop: [`workshop/level-1/`](workshop/level-1/) — 12 hands-on exercises with a sample Python app.

| Step | What to Try | What You'll Learn |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| 1-1 | Launch `copilot` in `workshop/level-1/sample-app/` and trust the folder | The trust prompt is a security gate — Copilot won't touch files until you consent |
| 1-2 | Type `/help` and read all sections | Discover all slash commands, shortcuts, and instruction file locations |
| 1-3 | Type `!ls -la` then `!wc -l *.py` | `!` runs shell commands **instantly** with zero AI token cost ([Docs][2]) |
| 1-4 | Ask: *"What is this project?"* | Copilot reads files to answer — observe tool approval prompts |
| 1-5 | Type `@ config.py` then ask: *"What options are available?"* | `@` injects file contents directly into context ([Docs][7]) |
| 1-6 | `@ task_manager.py` `@ models.py` then ask: *"Trace adding a new task"* | Deep multi-file exploration — data flow tracing |
| 1-7 | Ask: *"Count lines of Python code"* and observe the approval prompt | Understand Allow / Deny / Allow-for-session tool approval ([Docs][2]) |
| 1-8 | Type `/model`, `/usage`, then `/context` | Check your AI model, premium request stats, and token consumption ([Docs][3]) |
| 1-9 | Ask 3 follow-up questions about the same file without re-referencing it | Multi-turn conversation — Copilot remembers context across turns |
| 1-10 | Type `/compact` then `/context` to compare | Compress conversation history to free token space ([Docs][8]) |
| 1-11 | Exit (`Ctrl+C`), then `copilot --continue` | Session basics: exit, continue, and resume ([Docs][2]) |
| 1-12 | Ask *"How would I add X?"* vs *"Add X"* — and Deny the write | Distinguish questions (safe) from tasks (writes) — the Level 1 boundary |

**✅ Checkpoint:** You can navigate the UI, add file context, run shell commands, read tool approvals, manage context, and stay in read-only mode.

---

### Level 2: Understand — Ask Questions & Get Explanations

**Goal:** Use Copilot as a code understanding assistant. Still read-only — you're asking questions, not making changes.

> 📂 Full workshop: [`workshop/level-2/`](workshop/level-2/) — 12 hands-on exercises with a layered bookmark API app.

| Step | What to Try | What You'll Learn |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| 2-1 | Ask: *"Show the import dependency graph for all Python files"* | Map which file imports which — the foundation of any codebase |
| 2-2 | `@ app.py` `@ routes.py` `@ service.py` `@ repository.py` — ask about layers | Identify architectural layers and their responsibilities |
| 2-3 | *"Trace GET /bookmarks?tag=python from request to response"* | Top-down execution tracing through all layers |
| 2-4 | *"Where is DuplicateError raised? Trace up to the HTTP response"* | Bottom-up tracing — from component to all callers |
| 2-5 | `@ config.py` — ask: *"List all env vars with defaults and risks"* | Configuration audit and environment analysis |
| 2-6 | *"What design patterns are used? Which files implement them?"* | Pattern recognition (Repository, Factory, Exception hierarchy) |
| 2-7 | *"Find thread safety, validation, and error handling issues"* | Bug and code smell discovery without modifying code |
| 2-8 | *"What if the JSON file is deleted while the server runs?"* | Hypothetical reasoning — predict impact without changes |
| 2-9 | *"Compare InMemoryRepository vs FileRepository — which is better?"* | Compare implementations and articulate tradeoffs |
| 2-10 | *"Generate a complete API reference from routes.py"* | Documentation generation from code |
| 2-11 | *"Summarize this entire application in one paragraph"* | Knowledge synthesis — prove you understand the codebase |
| 2-12 | Try weak vs strong prompts on the same question — compare results | Advanced prompt crafting (structured, scoped, multi-step) |

**✅ Checkpoint:** You can map dependencies, trace execution paths, discover bugs, reason hypothetically, and craft deep prompts.

---

### Level 3: Plan — Think Before Acting

**Goal:** Learn to use Plan mode to create implementation plans **before** any code is written. This is the key habit that prevents runaway changes.

> 📂 Full workshop: [`workshop/level-3/`](workshop/level-3/) — 12 exercises with a note-taking app containing intentional bugs and TODOs.

| Step | What to Try | What You'll Learn |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| 3-1 | `/plan Fix the case-sensitive search bug in search.py` | Create your first plan and observe its structure ([Docs][7]) |
| 3-2 | Evaluate the plan: scope, completeness, safety, testing? | Read plans critically using a 6-point checklist |
| 3-3 | *"Too broad — focus only on X and Y"* then add constraints | Refine plans through iterative conversation |
| 3-4 | *"No — that's too big a change. Just add error handling"* | Reject plans with clear reasons and redirect |
| 3-5 | `/plan Fix the tag normalization bug` — consider data migration | Plan a bug fix (minimal change, backward-compatible) |
| 3-6 | `/plan Add search operators (tag:python, title:meeting)` | Plan a new feature (scope, interface, steps, testing) |
| 3-7 | `/plan Refactor the if/elif chain in notes.py` | Plan a refactoring (test-first, behavior-preserving) |
| 3-8 | Add constraints: *"Only modify export.py, max 30 lines, stdlib only"* | Plan with constraints that bound scope |
| 3-9 | `/plan Add a "last modified" sort` — trace through 3 files | Plan multi-file changes with safe implementation order |
| 3-10 | *"Give me 3 approaches — minimal, moderate, and robust"* | Compare alternative plans using a decision matrix |
| 3-11 | Plan from a user story with acceptance criteria | Translate requirements into concrete implementation plans |
| 3-12 | Review a complex plan against the 8-point checklist | Plan review as a repeatable skill (scope, risk, testing, migration, edge cases) |

**✅ Checkpoint:** You can create, evaluate, refine, reject, and compare plans — the foundation for every change you'll make in Levels 4–8.

---

**You will learn to:**
- Build custom extensions with the `@github/copilot-sdk`
- Conduct deep research with `/research`
- Configure lifecycle hooks (`preCompact`, `subagentStart`)
- Create personal skills in `~/.agents/skills/`
- Set up cross-tool instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`)
- Orchestrate the full extensibility ecosystem

📁 Location: `workshop/level-9/`

## Features (Detailed Reference)

### 🤖 User Interfaces and Modes

#### A) Interactive Interface (Default)

The standard conversational UI in the terminal for continuous work. ([Docs][3])

- Handles both general questions and implementation tasks.
- Dangerous operations (file changes, command execution) require **explicit approval**. ([Docs][2])
- Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle between modes within the interactive interface:
  - **Default mode** — ask questions and execute tasks
  - **Plan mode** — build structured implementation plans before coding ([Docs][7])
  - **Autopilot mode** — agent autonomously completes tasks (GA for all users since v0.0.411; press `Shift+Tab` to cycle)

#### B) Programmatic Interface

Pass a single prompt via `-p` / `--prompt` for **non-interactive, one-shot execution**. ([Docs][7])

```bash
copilot -p "Run the tests in this repo and summarize any failures"
```

Additional flags for scripting:
- `-s` / `--silent` — output only the response.
- Session sharing via Markdown or secret gist. ([Docs][7])

---

### 🔒 Safety Model: Approvals, Permissions & Restrictions

#### Approval-Based Execution

When Copilot attempts to use tools involving **modifications or execution** (e.g., `touch`, `chmod`, `node`, `sed`), you are prompted for approval. ([Docs][2])
You can also choose to **auto-approve a specific tool for the current session**. Since v0.0.407, there is an additional option to **approve permanently for a specific location** — this persists across sessions. Since v1.0.4, the path permission dialog also offers a **one-time approval** option (approve without adding to the permanent allowed list). ([Docs][2])

#### Allow All (Use with Caution)

`--allow-all` or `--yolo` grants all permissions (tools, paths, URLs) at once. This is equivalent to `--allow-all-tools --allow-all-paths --allow-all-urls`. **Only use in trusted environments.** ([Docs][8])

#### Fine-Grained Permission Control

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--allow-tool` / `--deny-tool` | Permit or block specific tools |
| `--allow-url` / `--deny-url` | Control web access by URL |
| `--allow-all-tools` | Auto-approve all tools without prompting |
| `--allow-all-paths` | Disable file path verification |
| `--allow-all-urls` | Allow access to all URLs |
| `--available-tools` | Limit tools visible to the model |
| `--excluded-tools` | Exclude specific tools entirely |
| `--disallow-temp-dir` | Prevent automatic access to system temp directory |

Tool specification syntax for `--allow-tool` / `--deny-tool`:

| Syntax | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `'shell(COMMAND)'` | `--deny-tool 'shell(rm)'` | Block a specific shell command |
| `'shell(git SUBCMD)'` | `--deny-tool 'shell(git push)'` | Block a git/gh subcommand |
| `'write'` | `--allow-tool 'write'` | Allow file modifications |
| `'MCP_SERVER(tool)'` | `--deny-tool 'MyMCP(tool_name)'` | Block a specific MCP tool |

([Docs][7])

---

### 📂 Context & Session Management

#### Session Restore

- `--resume` or `/resume` — switch between and restore local/remote sessions. ([Docs][2])
- `--continue` — quickly resume the most recent session. ([Docs][2])

#### Context Management (Token Awareness)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/usage` | View premium request and token consumption stats ([Docs][8]) |
| `/context` | Visualize token usage ([Docs][8]) |
| `/compact` | Summarize conversation history (context compression) ([Docs][8]) |

When token usage reaches ~95% of the limit, **automatic history compression** is triggered. ([Docs][8])

> 💡 **Cross-session memory** (experimental since v0.0.412): Copilot can store and recall facts about your repository across sessions, reducing the need to re-explain project conventions and preferences.

### 🧩 Custom Instructions, Custom Agents & MCP

#### Custom Instructions

Copilot CLI automatically reads Markdown instruction files from multiple locations. All instruction files **combine** (they are not priority-based fallbacks): ([Docs][2])

| File / Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Repository-wide |
| `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` | Path-specific (glob-matched) |
| `.github/AGENTS.md` | Coding Agent-specific |
| `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` | Model-specific instructions (in git root & cwd) |
| `$HOME/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` | User-level (all projects) |
| `~/.copilot/instructions/*.instructions.md` | User-level (cross-repo) |
| `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` | Additional directories (env var) |

#### Custom Agents

Define agent profiles (Markdown) specifying **expertise, tools, and instructions** to create specialized agents.
Copilot CLI includes built-in agents that it automatically delegates tasks to: ([Docs][2])

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Explore** | Quick codebase analysis — answer questions without adding to main context |
| **Task** | Execute commands (tests, builds) — brief summaries on success, full output on failure |
| **General-purpose** | Complex multi-step tasks with full toolset in a separate context |
| **Code-review** | Review changes surfacing only genuine issues, minimizing noise |
| **Configure-copilot** | Manage MCP servers, custom agents, and skills via conversational interface (since v1.0.4) |

Custom agents can be defined at user (`~/.copilot/agents`), repository (`.github/agents`),
or organization level (`.github-private/agents`). Use `/agent` to browse or `--agent=NAME` to specify. ([Docs][2])

#### Agent Skills (Reusable Prompts)

Prompt files (`.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`) define **reusable, invocable skills** that standardize
common workflows. Unlike instructions (passive context), skills are actively triggered by name.

> 📋 **This repository includes 13 reusable prompts** for content creation, maintenance, and learner onboarding:
>
> | Prompt | Mode | Purpose |
> |--------|------|---------|
> | **Content Creation** | | |
> | [`create-level`](.github/prompts/create-level.prompt.md) | agent | Scaffold a complete new workshop level (README + cheat sheet + sample app) |
> | [`create-exercise`](.github/prompts/create-exercise.prompt.md) | agent | Generate a single exercise in the standard format |
> | **Quality & Review** | | |
> | [`review-level`](.github/prompts/review-level.prompt.md) | agent | Audit a level for format consistency (20-point checklist) |
> | [`verify-bugs`](.github/prompts/verify-bugs.prompt.md) | agent | Confirm intentional sample app bugs are preserved |
> | [`sync-readme`](.github/prompts/sync-readme.prompt.md) | agent | Synchronize main README tables with actual level content |
> | [`cross-reference-validate`](.github/prompts/cross-reference-validate.prompt.md) | agent | Validate all internal links, external URLs, and cross-references |
> | **CLI Update Lifecycle** | | |
> | [`check-cli-updates`](.github/prompts/check-cli-updates.prompt.md) | agent | Discover what changed in the latest Copilot CLI release |
> | [`upstream-diff-analysis`](.github/prompts/upstream-diff-analysis.prompt.md) | agent | Deep section-by-section comparison of repo content vs official docs |
> | [`guide-refresh`](.github/prompts/guide-refresh.prompt.md) | agent | Update README.md and workshop/README.md after discovering changes |
> | [`workshop-refresh`](.github/prompts/workshop-refresh.prompt.md) | agent | Batch-update exercises and cheat sheets across all 9 levels |
> | [`sample-app-upgrade`](.github/prompts/sample-app-upgrade.prompt.md) | agent | Upgrade dependencies and verify code compatibility |
> | **Operations** | | |
> | [`workshop-setup`](.github/prompts/workshop-setup.prompt.md) | agent | Verify learner environment and recommend starting level |
> | [`weekly-maintenance`](.github/prompts/weekly-maintenance.prompt.md) | agent | All-in-one weekly routine: check → triage → fix → validate |

#### Agent Skills (Auto-Loaded by Copilot)

Agent Skills (`.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`) are an [open standard](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) —
folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Copilot **automatically loads when relevant** based on the
skill's description. Unlike prompt files (explicitly invoked), skills are injected into context when Copilot
determines they match the current task.

> 📋 **This repository includes 5 agent skills:**
>
> | Skill | Auto-Triggers When… | Includes |
> |-------|---------------------|----------|
> | [`workshop-exercise-authoring`](.github/skills/workshop-exercise-authoring/) | Creating or editing exercises | Exercise format template, numbering rules |
> | [`workshop-level-scaffolding`](.github/skills/workshop-level-scaffolding/) | Creating a new workshop level | Full checklist + `scaffold.sh` script |
> | [`sample-app-development`](.github/skills/sample-app-development/) | Editing sample-app code | Complete bug catalog, language standards |
> | [`workshop-content-review`](.github/skills/workshop-content-review/) | Reviewing or auditing content | 20-point checklist + `validate.sh` script |
> | [`workshop-learner-onboarding`](.github/skills/workshop-learner-onboarding/) | Asking about setup or getting started | Environment checks, starting level guide |

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Copilot CLI supports MCP server integration for extending tools and context. ([Features][6])

- GitHub MCP server is **included by default**. Use `/mcp` to manage servers. ([Docs][2])
- Default config location: `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (configurable via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). ([Docs][2])
- MCP config is also read from `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (since v1.0.3). ([Docs][2])
- Use `--disable-builtin-mcps` to control built-in MCP servers (e.g., `github-mcp-server`). ([Docs][7])
- Per-session MCP: `--additional-mcp-config` for temporary server configuration. ([Docs][7])

#### Delegation to Coding Agent

Hand off work from the CLI to Copilot Coding Agent on GitHub while preserving session context: ([Docs][2])

```bash
# Via slash command
/delegate complete the API integration tests

# Via & prefix
& complete the API integration tests
```

Copilot commits unstaged changes as a checkpoint, creates a branch, and opens a draft PR.

#### Hooks

Hooks execute custom shell commands at key points during agent execution, enabling validation, logging, security scanning, or workflow automation. ([Docs][3])

- **Personal hooks:** `~/.copilot/hooks/`
- **Repo hooks:** `.github/hooks/`
- **Hook types:** `startup` (prompt hooks), `preToolUse`, `preCompact` (since v1.0.5), `agentStop`
- **Configuration:** Use `disableAllHooks` flag to disable all hooks from a configuration file (since v1.0.4). Hooks can request user confirmation before tool execution with the `ask` permission decision (since v1.0.4).

#### Copilot Memory

Copilot Memory builds persistent understanding of your repository by storing "memories" — coding conventions, patterns, and preferences Copilot deduces as it works. This reduces the need to repeatedly explain context across sessions. ([Docs][3])

#### LSP (Language Server Protocol)

Copilot CLI supports LSP for enhanced code intelligence (go-to-definition, hover, diagnostics). Configure via `~/.copilot/lsp-config.json` (user-level) or `.github/lsp.json` (repo-level). Use `/lsp` to manage. ([Docs][2])

#### Extensions (Experimental)

Extensions allow Copilot to write custom tools and hooks for itself using the `@github/copilot-sdk`. Introduced experimentally in v1.0.3, extensions can be written as ES modules (`extension.mjs`). Use `/extensions` (since v1.0.5) to view, enable, and disable CLI extensions. The loaded extensions count is shown in the "Environment loaded" startup message.

#### Pull Request Workflow (`/pr`)

The `/pr` command (since v1.0.5) brings a complete PR workflow into the terminal: ([Docs][2])

- **Create PRs** from the current branch
- **View PR status** locally or open in browser (`/pr view [local|web]`)
- **Fix CI failures** automatically
- **Address review feedback** from PR reviewers
- **Resolve merge conflicts** interactively

#### Enhanced File Context (`@` Mentions)

Since v1.0.5, `@` file mentions support paths **outside** the current project directory:

| Syntax | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `@ filename` | `@ config.py` | File within the project (existing behavior) |
| `@ /absolute/path` | `@ /etc/hosts` | Absolute path on the filesystem |
| `@ ~/path` | `@ ~/.ssh/config` | Path relative to home directory |
| `@ ../path` | `@ ../shared/types.ts` | Relative parent path (outside project) |

### 🧠 Model Selection

- Default model: **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (changeable via `/model` or `--model`). ([Docs][3])
- Use `--reasoning-effort` to control reasoning depth: `low`, `medium` (default), `high`, `xhigh` (since v1.0.4).
- Auto-migrates users from deprecated models on startup.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6** added (2026-02-17) — excels in agentic coding and search operations. ([Blog][13])
- **Claude Opus 4.6** added (2026-02-05) — premium model for complex reasoning tasks.
- **GPT-5 mini** and **GPT-4.1** were added (2026-01-14) and are **included in Copilot subscriptions** without consuming premium requests. ([Blog][9])
- **GPT-5.4** added (2026-03-05) — latest OpenAI model. **GPT-5** was deprecated (2026-02-19).
- Copilot CLI usage itself **consumes premium request quota** (multiplier shown in model list). ([Features][6])
- View session stats with `/usage`. ([Docs][8])

> **Tip:** Use non-premium models for lightweight checks and high-performance models for complex tasks.

### 🔌 ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

Copilot CLI implements **ACP**, allowing third-party IDEs and automation systems to invoke Copilot's agent capabilities. ([Blog][10])

#### Starting ACP

```bash
# stdio mode
copilot --acp

# TCP mode
copilot --acp --port 8080
```

#### ACP Client Capabilities

- Feature discovery
- Per-working-directory session creation
- Prompts with text, images, and context resources
- Streaming responses
- Tool execution permission handling
- Cancel / session lifecycle management

([Blog][10])

### 📦 Copilot SDK (Embed the Agent in Your App)

The **Copilot SDK** lets you embed Copilot's agent execution loop (planner + tool loop + runtime) directly into your applications. ([Blog][4])

#### Architecture

```
Your Application
       ↓
  SDK Client
       ↓ JSON-RPC
Copilot CLI (server mode)
```

The SDK manages the CLI process lifecycle automatically. ([SDK Repo][5])

#### Quick Start (TypeScript)

```ts
import { CopilotClient } from "@github/copilot-sdk";
const client = new CopilotClient();

await client.start();
const session = await client.createSession({ model: "gpt-5.4" });
await session.send({ prompt: "Hello, world!" });
```

([Blog][4])

#### SDK Installation

```bash
# Node.js / TypeScript
npm install @github/copilot-sdk

# Python
pip install github-copilot-sdk

# Go
go get github.com/github/copilot-sdk/go

# .NET
dotnet add package GitHub.Copilot.SDK
```

([SDK Repo][5])

#### SDK Authentication

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| GitHub signed-in user | Uses `copilot` CLI login OAuth credentials |
| OAuth GitHub App | Pass your OAuth app's user token |
| Environment variables | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) | Use your own LLM provider API key (no GitHub auth needed) |

([SDK Repo][5])

> **⚠️ Important:** The SDK defaults to `--allow-all` permissions. For production/internal tools, configure **tool allowlists**, **fixed working directories**, and **URL domain restrictions** from the start. ([SDK Repo][5])

---

## Best Practices

1. **Plan first, then implement** — Use `/plan` to generate a plan before large changes. ([Docs][7])
2. **Diff → Review → Test before commit** — Make `/diff` and `/review` a pre-commit ritual. ([Docs][7])
3. **Use custom instructions strategically** — Place design principles, naming conventions, test policies, and prohibitions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Use path-specific instructions (`.github/instructions/`) for language- or directory-scoped rules, and `AGENTS.md` for Coding Agent behavior. ([Docs][2])
4. **Choose models by task weight** — Lightweight checks on non-premium models, heavy work on high-performance models.
5. **Start read-only, then graduate to writes** — Build trust in the approval flow before allowing file modifications.
6. **Use `/compact` proactively** — Don't wait for the 95% auto-compression; compress when switching tasks to keep context focused.
7. **Lock down permissions for sensitive repos** — Use `--deny-tool` and `--deny-url` to restrict what Copilot can do in production-adjacent environments.

## ⚠️ Note on Legacy Package

If you previously used `@githubnext/github-copilot-cli`, that is a **separate, unmaintained package**. The current official Copilot CLI is **`@github/copilot`**. ([npm][12])
