## About the Sample App

Level 8 uses a **DevOps Toolkit** — a multi-service project with automation scripts, CI pipelines, and security-sensitive configurations.

> Unlike previous levels which focused on a single application, this level uses a **multi-service, multi-language project** (Node.js API + Python worker) with shell scripts, CI workflows, and sensitive config files. The focus is not on the code itself but on how you **use Copilot** — permissions, automation, sessions, and delegation.

---

## Exercise 1: Fine-Grained Tool Permissions

### Goal
Master the `--allow-tool` and `--deny-tool` flags to control exactly what Copilot can do.

### Steps

**1.1** Start with default permissions (interactive approval):

```bash
cd workshop/level-8/sample-app
copilot
```

```
Create a new file called test.txt with the content "hello"
```

> Observe: you get an approval prompt for the `create` tool.

Exit and restart with pre-approved tools:

**1.2** Pre-approve specific tools:

```bash
copilot --allow-tool "view" --allow-tool "grep" --allow-tool "glob"
```

```
Show me the structure of services/api/ and find all JavaScript files
```

> Observe: `view`, `grep`, and `glob` execute without prompts. `create`, `edit`, and `bash` still require approval.

**1.3** Pre-approve write tools for a trusted session:

```bash
copilot --allow-tool "edit" --allow-tool "create" --allow-tool "view" --allow-tool "grep"
```

```
Add a comment to services/api/index.js: "// Level 8 exercise"
```

> Observe: the edit proceeds without an approval prompt.

**1.4** Deny a specific tool:

```bash
copilot --deny-tool "bash"
```

```
Run the tests with make test
```

> Observe: Copilot cannot use the `bash` tool at all — it's completely blocked. It should explain what it would do instead.

**1.5** Combine allow and deny:

```bash
copilot --allow-tool "view" --allow-tool "edit" --deny-tool "bash"
```

> This creates a session where Copilot can read and edit files but cannot execute any commands.

### Key Concept: Permission Matrix

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--allow-tool "X"` | Tool X runs without approval prompts |
| `--deny-tool "X"` | Tool X is completely blocked |
| Neither | Tool X requires interactive approval (default) |

| Scenario | Recommended Flags |
|----------|-------------------|
| Read-only exploration | `--allow-tool "view" --allow-tool "grep" --deny-tool "bash" --deny-tool "edit"` |
| Trusted editing session | `--allow-tool "view" --allow-tool "edit" --allow-tool "grep"` |
| Full auto-approve | `--allow-tool "view" --allow-tool "edit" --allow-tool "bash" --allow-tool "create"` |
| Maximum lockdown | `--deny-tool "bash" --deny-tool "edit" --deny-tool "create"` |

> 💡 **`--reasoning-effort` (v1.0.4):** Control how deeply the model reasons with `--reasoning-effort low|medium|high|xhigh`. Use `low` for quick lookups, `high` or `xhigh` for complex multi-step tasks. This flag complements permission flags — together they let you tune both **what** Copilot can do and **how hard** it thinks.

> 💡 **Permission subcommands (v1.0.12):** `/allow-all` now supports subcommands:
> - `/allow-all on` — Enable all permissions
> - `/allow-all off` — Disable all permissions (re-enable approval prompts)
> - `/allow-all show` — Display current permission state
>
> `/yolo` permissions now persist after `/clear` (v1.0.12), so resetting your conversation context doesn't reset your permission decisions.

> ⚠️ **Precedence rule:** If the same tool matches both `--allow-tool` and `--deny-tool` patterns, **`--deny-tool` wins** (safety first). When in doubt, the CLI errs on the side of caution.

> 💡 **Piped input context (for scripting):** When using `copilot -p "prompt" < file.txt`, the piped content is automatically included in the context — no need for `@` references in the prompt.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can configure tool permissions for any trust level.

---

## Exercise 2: Network Access Controls

### Goal
Control Copilot's ability to access URLs and external resources.

### Steps

**2.1** Default behavior — allow all URLs:

```bash
copilot
```

```
Fetch the content of https://api.github.com/zen
```

> If web access tools are available, Copilot can fetch external URLs.

**2.2** Block all network access:

```bash
copilot --deny-url "*"
```

```
Fetch the content of https://api.github.com/zen
```

> Copilot should be unable to access any URL.

**2.3** Allow specific domains only:

```bash
copilot --allow-url "https://api.github.com/*" --deny-url "*"
```

> This creates a session that can only access GitHub's API — nothing else.

**2.4** Block sensitive internal URLs:

```bash
copilot --deny-url "https://*.internal/*" --deny-url "https://vault.*"
```

> This prevents Copilot from accessing internal services or secret vaults.

**2.5** Understand when URL controls matter:

```
When would you use --deny-url? Think about:
- Production environments with internal services
- Compliance requirements (data residency)
- Air-gapped or restricted networks
- Preventing accidental data exfiltration
```

### Key Concept: URL Permission Patterns

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | All URLs |
| `https://api.github.com/*` | Any GitHub API URL |
| `https://*.internal/*` | Any internal domain |
| `https://example.com/api/v1/*` | Specific API path |

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can control network access for any security requirement.

---

## Exercise 3: Programmatic Mode Basics

### Goal
Use Copilot CLI non-interactively for scripting and automation.

### Steps

**3.1** Basic programmatic mode:

```bash
copilot -p "What is 2 + 2? Reply with just the number."
```

> This runs Copilot non-interactively — sends the prompt, gets a response, exits.

**3.2** Silent mode (script-friendly output):

```bash
copilot -p "List the files in the current directory" -s
```

> `-s` strips Copilot's conversational framing — outputs only the essential content.

**3.3** Compare normal vs silent output:

```bash
echo "=== Normal ==="
copilot -p "What language is services/api/index.js written in?"

echo "=== Silent ==="
copilot -p "What language is services/api/index.js written in?" -s
```

**3.4** Pipe input to Copilot:

```bash
cat services/api/index.js | copilot -p "Review this code for issues" -s
```

> The file content is piped as stdin context.

**3.5** Capture output:

```bash
REVIEW=$(copilot -p "Summarize services/api/index.js in one sentence" -s)
echo "Review: $REVIEW"
```

> Copilot's output is captured in a shell variable.

**3.6** Use in a script:

```bash
for file in services/api/*.js services/worker/*.py; do
    echo "--- $file ---"
    copilot -p "In one line, what does $file do?" -s
    echo ""
done
```

> This loops through files and asks Copilot about each one.

### Key Concept: Programmatic Mode Flags

| Flag | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `-p "prompt"` | Programmatic | Non-interactive, single prompt |
| `-s` | Silent | Script-friendly output only |
| `-p "..." -s` | Combined | Best for automation scripts |
| `--output-format json` | JSON output | Emit JSONL for machine-readable programmatic integrations (v0.0.422) |

> 💡 Use `--output-format json` when piping Copilot output into other tools or CI pipelines that need structured data instead of plain text.

> 💡 **Reasoning effort control (v1.0.4):** Use `--reasoning-effort` to control how deeply the AI thinks:
> ```bash
> copilot -p "Quick summary of this file" -s --reasoning-effort low
> copilot -p "Find all security vulnerabilities" -s --reasoning-effort xhigh
> ```
> Levels: `low` (fast, cheaper), `medium` (default), `high` (thorough), `xhigh` (maximum depth). Lower effort uses fewer premium requests — great for simple automation tasks.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can use Copilot non-interactively in shell scripts.

---

## Exercise 4: Building Automation Scripts

### Goal
Create and understand automation scripts that leverage Copilot CLI.

### Steps

**4.1** Read the existing review script:

```bash
copilot
```

```
@ scripts/copilot-review.sh

Explain this script: what does it do, how does it use copilot -p, 
and what are the edge cases?
```

**4.2** Read the changelog script:

```
@ scripts/copilot-changelog.sh

How does this script gather git history and pass it to Copilot?
```

**4.3** Read the triage script:

```
@ scripts/copilot-triage.sh

This script uses gh CLI + copilot CLI together. 
Explain the data flow: GitHub → gh CLI → shell → copilot -p → output
```

**4.4** Improve the review script:

```
The review script has a limitation: if the diff is very large, 
the prompt might exceed context limits. 

Add a check: if the diff is more than 500 lines, truncate it 
and add a note "... truncated (N lines omitted)".
```

**4.5** Create a new automation script:

```
Create a script scripts/copilot-summarize.sh that:
1. Accepts a directory path as argument
2. Lists all source files in the directory
3. For each file, asks Copilot for a one-line summary
4. Outputs a formatted table: filename | summary
5. Uses copilot -p -s for each call
```

**4.6** Test the script (dry run):

```
!bash scripts/copilot-summarize.sh services/api/ 2>&1 || echo "Expected: script created but copilot may not be available in this context"
```

### Key Concept: Automation Script Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Review** | PR quality gate | `git diff | copilot -p "review" -s` |
| **Changelog** | Release notes | `git log | copilot -p "categorize" -s` |
| **Triage** | Issue management | `gh issue view | copilot -p "triage" -s` |
| **Summary** | Documentation | `for file; copilot -p "summarize" -s` |
| **Migration** | Code transforms | `copilot -p "convert X to Y" -s` |

#### Hooks for Automation (v0.0.422)

Beyond scripts, Copilot CLI supports **hooks** — event-driven actions that fire at key lifecycle points:

| Hook Location | Scope |
|---------------|-------|
| `~/.copilot/hooks` | Personal hooks applied to every session |
| `.github/hooks` | Repository-level hooks shared with the team |

- **Startup prompt hooks** auto-submit commands or context at session start — useful for loading project-specific setup without manual steps.
- **`preToolUse` hooks** validate or deny tool execution before it happens (e.g., block `bash` calls matching a dangerous pattern).
- **`preCompact` hooks** (v1.0.5) run commands before context compaction — useful for saving state or snapshots before the context window is compressed.

Hook configurations also support:
- **`disableAllHooks` flag** (v1.0.4) — set in your config to temporarily disable all hooks without removing them.
- **`ask` permission** (v1.0.4) — hooks can request user confirmation before executing, adding a human-in-the-loop checkpoint for sensitive automation.

> 💡 Hooks complement `--allow-tool` / `--deny-tool` flags — flags set static permissions, hooks add dynamic runtime logic.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can build and understand automation scripts that wrap Copilot CLI.

---

## Exercise 5: Security Boundaries

### Goal
Configure Copilot to protect sensitive files and enforce security policies.

### Steps

**5.1** Demonstrate the risk — read production secrets:

```bash
copilot
```

```
@ config/production.env
What credentials are in this file?
```

> ⚠️ Copilot can read and display the fake production secrets. In a real project, this is a security risk.

**5.2** Create a `.copilotignore` that blocks sensitive files:

```
Create a .copilotignore file that excludes:
- config/production.env
- Any *.pem or *.key files
- Any .env files except development.env
- The .git directory
```

**5.3** Verify the protection:

```
@ config/production.env
Can you read this file?
```

> With `.copilotignore`, Copilot should not be able to load this file.

**5.4** Use tool permissions as a second layer:

```bash
copilot --deny-tool "bash"
```

> Even if `.copilotignore` is bypassed, blocking `bash` prevents `!cat config/production.env`.

**5.5** Create a security-hardened session:

```bash
copilot \
  --deny-tool "bash" \
  --deny-url "*" \
  --allow-tool "view" \
  --allow-tool "grep" \
  --allow-tool "edit"
```

> This session: can read and edit files, but cannot execute commands or access the network. Combined with `.copilotignore`, sensitive files are excluded from reads too.

**5.6** Document your security policy:

```
Create a docs/copilot-security-policy.md that documents:
1. Which files are excluded via .copilotignore
2. Recommended permission flags for different environments
3. What to do if Copilot accidentally displays secrets
```

### Key Concept: Defense in Depth

```
Layer 1: .copilotignore          ← Excludes files from context
Layer 2: --deny-tool "bash"      ← Blocks command execution
Layer 3: --deny-url "*"          ← Blocks network access
Layer 4: Custom instructions     ← "Never display API keys or passwords"
Layer 5: Shell security guards   ← CLI prompts on dangerous expansion/substitution (v0.0.423)
Layer 6: Org policy enforcement  ← Block third-party MCP servers when org policy disallows (v0.0.416)
```

> 💡 **No single layer is sufficient.** Use all four static layers together for sensitive environments. Layers 5 and 6 are automatic guardrails provided by the CLI and your organization respectively — they protect even when other layers are not configured.

> 💡 **`/reset-allowed-tools` improvement (v1.0.3):** This command now fully undoes `/allow-all` and re-triggers the autopilot permission dialog, giving you a clean way to revoke broad permissions mid-session without restarting.

> 💡 **Organization MCP policy (v1.0.11):** Organizations can now enforce policies on which third-party MCP servers are allowed. This adds a fifth security layer:
>
> | Layer | Control | Scope |
> |-------|---------|-------|
> | 1 | `.copilotignore` | Exclude files from context |
> | 2 | `--deny-tool` | Block specific tools |
> | 3 | `--deny-url` | Block network access |
> | 4 | Custom instructions | Behavioral guardrails |
> | 5 | **Org MCP policy** | Enterprise-enforced tool restrictions (v1.0.11) |

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can configure multi-layered security boundaries for Copilot sessions.

---

## Exercise 6: Session Management Deep Dive

### Goal
Master session lifecycle — creation, continuation, resumption, and context reset.

### Steps

**6.1** Start a named session (conceptual):

```bash
copilot
```

```
Add a comment to services/api/index.js: "// Session exercise"
```

Note the session context — you're working on the API service.

**6.2** Exit and continue:

Press `Ctrl+C` or type `/exit` to exit.

```bash
copilot --continue
```

> Your conversation history and file context are restored.

**6.3** Verify context preservation:

```
What was the last thing we did?
```

> Copilot should remember the previous conversation.

**6.4** Clear context within a session:

```
/clear
```

```
What was the last thing we did?
```

> After `/clear`, Copilot no longer has the previous context.

**6.5** Exit and resume a different session:

```bash
copilot --resume
```

> This shows a list of recent sessions to choose from.

**6.6** Understand session storage:

```
Where are Copilot sessions stored on disk?
How much storage do they use?
Can I delete old sessions?
```

### Key Concept: Session Strategy Matrix

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Pick up where I left off | `copilot --continue` |
| Return to a specific session | `copilot --resume` |
| Start fresh, forget everything | `copilot` |
| Reset context but keep session | `/clear` |
| Permanently exit | `Ctrl+C` or `/exit` |

> 💡 **New session commands (v1.0.13):**
> - **`/rewind`** — The most powerful undo: reverts your last conversation turn AND all associated file changes in one command
> - **`/new`** — Start a fresh conversation while keeping your settings, working directory, and environment intact
> - **`/session`** — View session metadata including ID, model, and token usage
> - **`/session rename <name>`** — Give your session a memorable name for easier resumption

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can manage sessions for any workflow pattern.

---

## Exercise 7: Multi-Session Workflows

### Goal
Work on multiple tasks simultaneously using separate Copilot sessions.

### Steps

**7.1** Session 1 — work on the API service:

```bash
cd services/api
copilot
```

```
Add a new route: GET /version that returns { version: "1.0.0", commit: "abc123" }
```

Exit with `Ctrl+C`.

**7.2** Session 2 — work on the worker service:

```bash
cd ../../services/worker
copilot
```

```
Add a new job type "cleanup" that deletes completed jobs older than 24 hours
```

Exit with `Ctrl+C`.

**7.3** Resume Session 1:

```bash
cd ../api
copilot --resume
```

> Select the API session from the list. Continue working on the API.

**7.4** Resume Session 2:

```bash
cd ../worker
copilot --resume
```

> Select the worker session. Continue working on the worker.

**7.5** Understand multi-session strategies:

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **One session, one task** | Focused work on a single feature |
| **Multiple sessions, different services** | Working across microservices |
| **Session per issue** | Tracking work by issue/ticket |
| **Disposable sessions** | Quick questions, then forget |

**7.6** Cross-session context:

```
I was working on the API service in another session. 
I added a /version endpoint. Can you see those changes from this session?
```

> Sessions are isolated. Changes on disk (saved files) are visible, but conversation context is not shared.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can manage parallel sessions for multi-task workflows.

---

## Exercise 8: Copilot Coding Agent

### Goal
Understand how to delegate entire tasks to GitHub's Copilot Coding Agent via issues and PRs.

### Steps

**8.1** Understand what the Coding Agent is:

```
Explain the difference between:
1. Copilot CLI (what we've been using)
2. Copilot Coding Agent (assigns to issues/PRs)
3. Copilot in the IDE (VS Code, JetBrains)

When would you use each one?
```

**8.2** Learn the Coding Agent workflow:

```
Walk me through the Copilot Coding Agent workflow:
1. How do I assign an issue to it?
2. What does it do after assignment?
3. Where does its work appear?
4. How do I review and iterate on its changes?
```

**8.3** Write an agent-friendly issue:

```
Write a GitHub issue that would be good for the Copilot Coding Agent:
- Clear title
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Specific files to modify
- Test expectations

Use this project (the DevOps Toolkit) as the context.
```

**8.4** Write a bad issue (and understand why):

```
Write an issue that would be BAD for the Copilot Coding Agent. 
Explain why it would fail or produce poor results.
```

**8.5** Agent vs CLI decision framework:

| Task Type | Best Tool | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Quick fix, known file | **CLI** | Faster, immediate feedback |
| Multi-file feature | **Coding Agent** | Handles complexity, creates PR |
| Exploration/questions | **CLI** | Interactive conversation |
| Repetitive changes | **Coding Agent** | Batch processing |
| Security-sensitive | **CLI** | You control every step |
| Well-defined, testable | **Coding Agent** | Clear acceptance criteria |
| Ambiguous, needs discussion | **CLI** | Iterative refinement |

**8.6** PR review workflow for agent changes:

```
When the Coding Agent creates a PR, how should I review it?
What's different from reviewing a human's PR?
What should I look for specifically?
```

### Key Concept: Coding Agent Workflow

```
1. Create Issue          ← Clear title, acceptance criteria, test expectations
2. Assign to Copilot     ← @copilot or assign in UI
3. Agent creates branch  ← Autonomous implementation
4. Agent opens PR        ← With description of changes
5. You review PR         ← Like any code review
6. Iterate via comments  ← "Fix X", "Add test for Y"
7. Merge when ready      ← Standard merge flow
```

> 💡 **Multi-remote support (v0.0.422):** When delegating via `/delegate`, the CLI now prompts you to select the target remote if multiple remotes are configured — useful for fork-based workflows.

> 💡 **GHE Cloud support (v0.0.394):** The Coding Agent is available on GitHub Enterprise Cloud (`*.ghe.com`) in addition to github.com.

> 💡 **`/pr` command (v1.0.5):** The `/pr` command brings the full PR workflow into your terminal — create PRs, view status, fix CI failures, address review feedback, and resolve merge conflicts without leaving the CLI. This is a powerful complement to the Coding Agent: while the agent creates PRs autonomously from issues, `/pr` lets you manage the entire PR lifecycle interactively.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You understand the Coding Agent workflow and when to use CLI vs Agent.

---

## Exercise 9: CI/CD Integration

### Goal
Understand how to integrate Copilot CLI into continuous integration pipelines.

### Steps

**9.1** Read the CI workflow:

```
@ .github/workflows/copilot-ci.yml

Explain this workflow:
- What triggers it?
- What does each job do?
- What's placeholder vs real?
```

**9.2** Understand the PR review job:

```
The review-pr job gets the PR diff and would pass it to copilot -p.
What are the practical considerations?
- Token management
- Context limits (large PRs)
- Output formatting for PR comments
- Rate limiting
```

**9.3** Understand the triage job:

```
The triage-issue job would use copilot -p to triage new issues.
How would you post the triage result back to the issue as a comment?
```

**9.4** Design a real CI integration:

```
/plan Design a CI workflow that uses Copilot CLI for:
1. PR review: run copilot -p on the diff, post review as PR comment
2. Test failure analysis: if tests fail, use copilot -p to explain failures
3. Security scan: use copilot -p to review changes for security issues

What environment variables and secrets are needed?
How do you handle rate limits?
```

**9.5** CI security considerations:

```
What are the security risks of running Copilot in CI?
- Exposure of code to the AI model
- Token permissions
- Untrusted PRs from forks
- Cost control
```

**9.6** Best practices:

```
Create a docs/ci-copilot-guide.md with best practices for 
using Copilot CLI in GitHub Actions.
```

### Key Concept: CI Integration Architecture

```
GitHub Event (PR, Issue, Release)
    │
    ▼
GitHub Actions Workflow
    │
    ▼
copilot -p "prompt" -s      ← Non-interactive, silent
    │
    ▼
Post result via gh CLI       ← Comment on PR/Issue
```

#### Machine-Readable Pipeline Output

For CI jobs that need to parse Copilot results programmatically, use `--output-format json` to get structured JSONL output instead of plain text:

```bash
# In a GitHub Actions step
copilot -p "Analyze the diff for security issues" --output-format json > analysis.jsonl
# Parse with jq or other JSON tools
cat analysis.jsonl | jq -r '.content // empty'
```

> 💡 `--output-format json` (v0.0.422) is especially valuable in pipelines where downstream steps need to branch on Copilot's response content.

> 💡 **OpenTelemetry instrumentation (v1.0.4):** Copilot CLI supports OpenTelemetry tracing for observability into agent sessions, LLM calls, and tool executions. In CI/CD pipelines, this lets you monitor agent performance, track token usage, and debug slow or failing AI steps alongside your standard pipeline telemetry.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You understand CI/CD integration patterns, security, and best practices.

## Exercise 10: Agent Control Plane & SDK Concepts

### Goal
Understand the broader Copilot ecosystem — ACP and SDK — and where CLI fits in.

### Steps

**10.1** Understand the ecosystem:

```
Explain the GitHub Copilot ecosystem:
1. Copilot in IDE (code completion)
2. Copilot Chat (IDE)
3. Copilot CLI (terminal)
4. Copilot Coding Agent (issues/PRs)
5. Copilot SDK (build your own)
6. Agent Control Plane (ACP)

How do they relate to each other?
```

**10.2** Understand ACP:

```
What is the Agent Control Plane (ACP)?
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it relate to MCP?
- Who would use it?
```

**10.3** Understand the SDK:

```
What can you build with the Copilot SDK?
- Custom AI tools
- IDE extensions
- Workflow integrations
- Enterprise-specific agents

Give me 3 concrete examples.
```

**10.4** When to extend vs when to use:

| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Day-to-day coding | CLI + IDE |
| Repetitive automation | CLI programmatic mode + scripts |
| Team-wide tools | MCP servers |
| Enterprise workflow | SDK + ACP |
| Task delegation | Coding Agent |
| Custom tools & hooks | CLI extensions (`@github/copilot-sdk`) |
| MCP server management | `configure-copilot` built-in agent (v1.0.4) |

> 💡 **CLI extensions (experimental since v1.0.3, `/extensions` command since v1.0.5):** Extensions let you write custom tools and hooks using `@github/copilot-sdk`, extending the CLI's capabilities beyond built-in tools. Manage them with `/extensions` to view, enable, or disable installed extensions. This is the path for teams that need project-specific tooling without building a full MCP server.

> 💡 **`configure-copilot` agent (v1.0.4):** A built-in sub-agent specifically for managing MCP servers, custom agents, and skills configuration. Instead of manually editing JSON config files, ask the `configure-copilot` agent to add, remove, or modify your setup.

> 💡 **Session SDK APIs (v1.0.7 experimental):** The experimental session SDK now provides APIs to programmatically list and manage skills, MCP servers, and plugins. This opens the door to building custom tooling that integrates with Copilot CLI sessions programmatically.

> 💡 **Personal skills directory (v1.0.11):** Place skills in `~/.agents/skills/` to make them available to both Copilot CLI and VS Code's Copilot extension — one skill definition works across both tools.

**10.5** Map your organization's needs:

```
For a team of 10 developers working on 3 microservices:
- Which Copilot tools should they use?
- What custom integrations would help?
- What's the build vs buy decision?
```

### ✅ Checkpoint
You understand the Copilot ecosystem and where each component fits.

## Exercise 11: Delegation Decision Framework

### Goal
Build a systematic framework for deciding when to use which tool.

### Steps

**11.1** Review the delegation spectrum:

```
There's a spectrum from "fully manual" to "fully autonomous":

Manual ←────────────────────────────→ Autonomous
  │         │           │           │
  You    CLI+You    Coding     Automated
 alone   together    Agent      Pipeline

For each point on the spectrum, give an example task 
from this workshop.
```

**11.2** Create a decision tree:

```
Help me create a decision tree for delegation:

Question 1: Is the task well-defined with clear acceptance criteria?
  No → Use CLI interactively (iterate on requirements)
  Yes → Continue

Question 2: Does it need real-time human judgment?
  Yes → Use CLI interactively
  No → Continue

Question 3: Is it a single file or multi-file?
  ...continue building the tree
```

**11.3** Apply the framework to real scenarios:

| Scenario | Your Decision | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Fix a typo in README | ? | ? |
| Implement OAuth login | ? | ? |
| Add tests for 10 functions | ? | ? |
| Debug a production incident | ? | ? |
| Upgrade dependencies | ? | ? |
| Write API documentation | ? | ? |

**11.4** Evaluate delegation quality:

```
How do you measure whether a delegation was successful?
- Time saved vs time spent reviewing
- Quality of output
- Number of iterations needed
- Risk of missed issues
```

**11.5** Create a team delegation guide:

```
Create a docs/delegation-guide.md with:
1. Decision tree (from 11.2)
2. Tool selection matrix (from 11.3)
3. Quality checklist for reviewing delegated work
4. Escalation criteria (when to take back control)
```

### ✅ Checkpoint
You have a systematic framework for delegation decisions.

## Exercise 12: Capstone — Personal Mastery Framework

### Goal
Synthesize all 8 levels into a personal reference that you'll use daily.

### Steps

**12.1** Reflect on each level:

| Level | Key Skill | My Confidence (1-5) | Most Useful For |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1. Observe | Read-only exploration | ? | ? |
| 2. Understand | Ask questions, get explanations | ? | ? |
| 3. Plan | Think before acting | ? | ? |
| 4. Create | Approve changes, verify with diff/review | ? | ? |
| 5. Execute | Run commands, interpret output | ? | ? |
| 6. Workflow | Complete development cycles | ? | ? |
| 7. Customize | Instructions, MCP, context | ? | ? |
| 8. Advanced | Permissions, sessions, delegation | ? | ? |

**12.2** Identify your daily workflow:

```
Based on all 8 levels, what would my ideal daily Copilot workflow look like?
Walk through a typical day:
- Morning: start session, load context
- Feature work: plan → implement → test → review
- Code review: /review on PRs
- Issue triage: programmatic mode
- End of day: commit, clean up
```

**12.3** Create your personal cheat sheet:

```
Create a docs/my-cheat-sheet.md that combines the most useful 
commands and patterns from all 8 levels into a single reference 
I can keep open while working.

Organize by task type:
1. Starting a session
2. Reading code
3. Planning changes
4. Making changes
5. Running tests
6. Reviewing code
7. Automating tasks
8. Security & permissions
```

**12.4** Set improvement goals:

```
Based on my self-assessment, what are my top 3 improvement goals?
For each goal, suggest:
- A specific exercise to repeat
- A daily practice habit
- A metric to track progress
```

**12.5** Plan your team rollout:

```
If I wanted to train my team on Copilot CLI:
- Which levels should they start with?
- What's the minimum viable training (2-hour workshop)?
- What ongoing practices should we establish?
- How do we measure team adoption success?
```

**12.6** Final exercise — full synthesis:

```
Give me a one-page summary of everything I learned across all 8 levels.
Structure it as:
- 8 key principles (one per level)
- 8 most-used commands
- 8 anti-patterns to avoid
- My recommended workflow
```

### ✅ Checkpoint
You have a personal mastery framework and a plan for continued growth.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Permissions are your first line of defense** — configure them explicitly, not just "allow all"
2. **Programmatic mode unlocks automation** — `-p` and `-s` turn Copilot into a CLI tool
3. **Sessions have strategy** — continue vs resume vs fresh depends on the task
4. **Security is layered** — `.copilotignore` + `--deny-tool` + `--deny-url` + instructions
5. **The Coding Agent handles what CLI can't** — multi-file features with PR workflow
6. **CI integration requires careful security design** — tokens, permissions, fork handling
7. **Delegation is a spectrum** — manual → CLI → agent → pipeline, each has a place
8. **The ecosystem is bigger than CLI** — IDE, Chat, Agent, SDK, ACP all serve different needs
9. **Build your personal framework** — daily workflow + cheat sheet + decision tree
10. **Teach to solidify** — explaining Copilot to others deepens your own understanding
