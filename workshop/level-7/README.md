## Prerequisites

- [ ] Completed **Levels 1–6** (all workflow skills)
- [ ] Familiarity with the Event API sample app structure
- [ ] A GitHub account with Copilot access

---

## About the Sample App

Level 7 uses an **Event API** — a TypeScript Express application with specific conventions that benefit from custom Copilot instructions.

> Unlike Levels 1–6 which all used Python, this level switches to **TypeScript** to demonstrate that Copilot CLI customization (instructions, context, MCP) works across any language. The app has strong conventions (AppError, ApiResponse, logger) that Copilot should learn to follow through your custom instructions.

### Key Conventions (the ones you'll teach Copilot)

| Convention | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Error handling | `AppError.badRequest("msg", "CODE")` — never plain `Error` |
| Responses | `respondSuccess(data)` — never raw JSON |
| Logging | `logger.info("msg", { context })` — never `console.log` |
| Validation | Zod schemas via `validateBody(schema)` middleware |
| Testing | `describe`/`it` blocks — never `test()` |
| Imports | Named imports — never `import *` |
| Naming | camelCase functions, PascalCase types |

## Exercise 1: Writing Custom Instructions

### Goal
Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — the file that teaches Copilot your project's conventions.

### Steps

**1.1** Explore the codebase conventions:

```bash
cd workshop/level-7/sample-app
copilot
```

```
@ src/utils/errors.ts
@ src/utils/logger.ts
@ src/utils/response.ts

What conventions does this project follow for error handling, logging, and API responses?
```

**1.2** Read the starter instructions:

```
@ docs/starter-instructions.md

These are basic custom instructions. What's missing? 
Compare them to what you see in the actual code.
```

**1.3** Create the custom instructions file:

```
Based on the conventions you see in the codebase, create a 
.github/copilot-instructions.md file with comprehensive instructions.

Include sections for:
- Language & runtime
- Code style (naming, imports, const vs let)
- Error handling (AppError, factory methods, error codes)
- API responses (ApiResponse<T>, respondSuccess, respondPaginated)
- Logging (logger, never console.log, structured context)
- Validation (Zod, validateBody middleware)
- Testing (Jest, describe/it, beforeEach)
- Architecture (routes vs services vs models)
- Files to ignore (generated/, dist/)
```

**1.4** Compare with the comprehensive reference:

```
@ docs/comprehensive-instructions.md

Compare the instructions you generated with this reference.
What did you miss? What did you add that the reference doesn't have?
```

**1.5** Refine your instructions:

```
Update .github/copilot-instructions.md to incorporate anything 
important from the reference that we missed.
```

### Key Concept: Custom Instructions

| Aspect | Good Instruction | Bad Instruction |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Specificity | "Use `AppError.badRequest()` for 400 errors" | "Handle errors properly" |
| Examples | "Import as: `import { logger } from '../utils/logger'`" | "Use the logger" |
| Negative rules | "Never use `console.log`" | (omitting what NOT to do) |
| Context | "In route handlers, use `respondSuccess(data)`" | "Return JSON" |

> 💡 **User-level instructions (v0.0.412+):** You can also place instruction files at `~/.copilot/instructions/*.instructions.md` to apply personal conventions across all repositories — useful for preferences that follow you everywhere (e.g., "always explain before changing"). Use the `/instructions` command (v0.0.407+) to view and toggle which instruction files are active in your current session.

> 💡 **Expanded instruction sources (v1.0.13):** Copilot CLI now recognizes additional instruction files beyond `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:
> - **`CLAUDE.md`** — Compatible with Claude Code; Copilot reads this too
> - **`GEMINI.md`** — Compatible with Gemini CLI; Copilot reads this too
> - **`AGENTS.md`** — Agent-specific instructions (in git root and cwd)
> - **`COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS`** — Environment variable pointing to additional instruction directories
>
> This means you can write instructions once that work across Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI simultaneously.

> 💡 **Configuration files (v1.0.12):** Copilot also reads `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` as configuration sources, enabling cross-tool settings compatibility.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You have a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` that encodes your project's conventions.

---

## Exercise 2: Testing & Refining Instructions

### Goal
Verify that Copilot actually follows your instructions, and refine them when it doesn't.

### Steps

**2.1** Test: ask Copilot to generate a new service function:

```
Add a "cancelEvent" function to eventService.ts that:
- Takes eventId and requesterId
- Checks only organizer can cancel
- Sets status to "cancelled"
- Returns the updated event
```

**2.2** Evaluate the generated code against your instructions:

| Check | Expected | Pass? |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Uses `AppError.unauthorized()` | ✓ | |
| Uses `logger.info()` not `console.log` | ✓ | |
| Returns `Event` type | ✓ | |
| Follows naming conventions | ✓ | |
| No `import *` | ✓ | |

**2.3** If any checks fail, strengthen the instructions:

```
My instructions say to use AppError but Copilot used plain Error.
How should I rephrase the instruction to be clearer?
```

**2.4** Test again with a different generation:

```
Create a new route handler in routes/events.ts for the cancelEvent endpoint.
POST /api/events/:id/cancel
```

**2.5** Evaluate again:

| Check | Expected | Pass? |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Uses `respondSuccess()` wrapper | ✓ | |
| Error handling via `next(err)` | ✓ | |
| Reads `x-user-id` from headers | ✓ | |
| No business logic in route | ✓ | |

**2.6** Test with test generation:

```
Write tests for the cancelEvent function in eventService.test.ts.
```

| Check | Expected | Pass? |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Uses `describe`/`it` (not `test()`) | ✓ | |
| Uses `beforeEach` with `_clearAll()` | ✓ | |
| Tests both success and error paths | ✓ | |
| Uses `toThrow(AppError)` | ✓ | |

### Key Concept: Instruction Testing Loop

```
Write instructions → Generate code → Evaluate → Refine → Repeat
```

> 💡 **Instructions are never "done."** Every time Copilot generates code that doesn't follow a convention, add or clarify the instruction. This is an iterative process.

> 💡 **Verify loaded instructions (v1.0.13):** Use the `/instructions` command to see exactly which instruction files are loaded in your current session. You can toggle individual files on/off to test which instructions affect Copilot's behavior. This is invaluable for debugging instruction conflicts.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You've tested instructions across service, route, and test generation and refined gaps.

---

## Exercise 3: Context Optimization with `@`

### Goal
Learn to load exactly the right context for each task — not too much, not too little.

### Steps

**3.1** Too little context — ask without references:

```
Add a getEventsByOrganizer function
```

> Observe: Copilot might not use AppError, logger, or follow conventions because it doesn't have the context files loaded.

**3.2** Too much context — load everything:

```
@ src/routes/events.ts
@ src/middleware/errorHandler.ts
@ src/middleware/validation.ts
@ src/services/eventService.ts
@ src/models/event.ts
@ src/utils/errors.ts
@ src/utils/logger.ts
@ src/utils/response.ts

Add a getEventsByOrganizer function
```

> This works but wastes context tokens loading files that aren't relevant.

**3.3** Just right — targeted context:

```
@ src/services/eventService.ts
@ src/models/event.ts

Add a getEventsByOrganizer function to eventService.ts
```

> This gives Copilot the service patterns and the model types — exactly what it needs.

**3.4** Practice context targeting for different tasks:

| Task | Best Context Files |
|------|--------------------|
| New service function | `eventService.ts` + `event.ts` |
| New route handler | `routes/events.ts` + `eventService.ts` |
| New middleware | `errorHandler.ts` or `validation.ts` |
| New test | `eventService.test.ts` + the file being tested |
| Fix a bug | The buggy file + its test file |

**3.5** Test the "context map" approach:

```
I'm about to write a new middleware for rate limiting.
Which files should I load as context? Just list them.
```

> Copilot should suggest the right files based on the task.

### Key Concept: Context Budget

| Strategy | Context Usage | Quality |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| No `@` | Minimal | Low — misses conventions |
| `@` everything | Maximum | Good but wasteful |
| `@` targeted files | Optimal | Best — precise conventions, room for discussion |

> 💡 **The context window is finite.** Every file loaded reduces space for conversation. Load what matters, skip what doesn't.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can target exactly the right context files for any given task.

---

## Exercise 4: Creating `.copilotignore`

### Goal
Exclude irrelevant files so Copilot never wastes context on auto-generated or third-party code.

### Steps

**4.1** Identify files that should be excluded:

```
List all files in the project. Which ones are auto-generated, 
compiled, or third-party? These should never be loaded as context.
```

**4.2** Create `.copilotignore`:

```
Create a .copilotignore file in the project root that excludes:
- generated/ (auto-generated files)
- dist/ (compiled output)
- node_modules/ (third-party)
- package-lock.json (large, auto-generated)
- *.map files (source maps)
- coverage/ (test coverage reports)
```

**4.3** Verify it works — try to reference an excluded file:

```
@ generated/openapi.json
What does this file contain?
```

> With `.copilotignore` active, Copilot should either skip or note that this file is excluded.

**4.4** Test that important files are NOT excluded:

```
@ src/services/eventService.ts
Show me the createEvent function.
```

> This should work normally.

**4.5** Consider what else to exclude:

```
Are there any other files that might pollute context? 
Think about: lock files, IDE settings, CI configs, 
large data files, binary files.
```

### Key Concept: `.copilotignore` Syntax

```gitignore
# Auto-generated — never manually edit
generated/
dist/

# Third-party
node_modules/

# Build artifacts
*.map
*.d.ts
coverage/

# Large files with no useful code context
package-lock.json
*.sql
```

> The syntax is identical to `.gitignore`. Copilot CLI reads this file and excludes matching files from automatic context loading.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You have a `.copilotignore` that keeps context clean and focused.

---

## Exercise 5: Building Prompt Templates

### Goal
Create reusable prompt patterns that your team can use for consistent, high-quality interactions.

### Steps

**5.1** Create a prompt template for new service functions:

```
Here's a template I want to use every time I add a new service function:

"Add a [FUNCTION_NAME] function to [SERVICE_FILE].
Requirements: [LIST]
Context files: @ [SERVICE_FILE] @ [MODEL_FILE]
Follow error handling, logging, and naming conventions from instructions."

Can you refine this template to be more effective?
```

**5.2** Create a template for new API endpoints:

```
Create a prompt template for adding a new REST endpoint:
- Route definition in routes/
- Request validation with Zod
- Service call
- Response formatting
Include which files to @ reference.
```

**5.3** Create a template for bug fixes:

```
Create a prompt template for fixing a bug:
- Reproduce the issue
- Investigate root cause
- Plan the fix
- Implement
- Write regression test
- Verify
```

**5.4** Create a template for code review:

```
Create a prompt template for reviewing changes:
- Check conventions compliance
- Security review
- Test coverage
- Performance
```

**5.5** Save your templates:

```
Create a file docs/prompt-templates.md that contains all 4 templates 
formatted as reusable checklists.
```

### Key Concept: Prompt Templates

| Template | Purpose | Typical `@` References |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| New service function | Add business logic | Service file + model file |
| New endpoint | Add HTTP route | Routes file + service file |
| Bug fix | Investigate and fix | Bug file + test file |
| Code review | Review changes | Changed files |
| New test | Add test coverage | Test file + source file |

> 💡 **Templates encode your team's best practices.** Share them in your repository's docs so everyone starts with the same quality level.

> 💡 **Template variables (v1.0.12):** Configuration files now support `{{project_dir}}` and `{{plugin_data_dir}}` template variables, making paths portable across different machines and environments.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You have reusable prompt templates for common development tasks.

---

## Exercise 6: Understanding MCP Servers

### Goal
Understand what MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are and how they extend Copilot.

### Steps

**6.1** Ask Copilot to explain MCP:

```
What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)? 
How does it relate to Copilot CLI? 
What can MCP servers do that Copilot can't do on its own?
```

**6.2** Understand the MCP architecture:

```
Draw the architecture of MCP in text:
- Where does the MCP server run?
- How does Copilot CLI connect to it?
- What types of tools can MCP servers expose?
```

**6.3** Explore common MCP server use cases:

```
What are the most useful MCP servers for a TypeScript API project like ours?
Examples: database access, API documentation, deployment, monitoring.
```

**6.4** Understand the security model:

```
When an MCP server exposes a tool, who approves its execution?
How is it different from the bash tool approval?
```

**6.5** Understand the configuration:

```
Where is MCP server configuration stored?
What's the difference between:
- Project-level MCP config (.github/copilot/mcp.json)
- Workspace-local MCP config (.vscode/mcp.json)
- User-level MCP config
```

> 💡 Since v0.0.407, you can also use `.vscode/mcp.json` as a workspace-local MCP configuration alternative — useful when you already use VS Code workspace settings.

> 💡 **Dev Container support (v1.0.3):** MCP configuration is now also read from `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, making it easy to pre-configure MCP servers for Codespaces and Dev Container environments — your team gets the right tools automatically on container creation.

> 💡 **Organization policy (v1.0.11):** Organizations can now enforce policies on which third-party MCP servers are allowed. If you see a warning about blocked MCP servers, check with your org admin — this is an enterprise security feature.

> 💡 **MCP at git root (v1.0.12):** You can now place `.mcp.json` directly at the git repository root as an MCP configuration source — simpler than the `.github/copilot/mcp.json` path.

> 💡 **MCP sampling (v1.0.13):** MCP servers can now request LLM inference (sampling) — meaning external tools can ask Copilot's AI model to generate text as part of their workflow. Each such request requires your approval.

### Key Concept: MCP Overview

```
┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│   Copilot CLI        │────▶│   MCP Server         │
│   (client)           │◀────│   (tool provider)    │
└─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
        │                           │
        │ Uses built-in tools:      │ Exposes additional tools:
        │ - bash, edit, view        │ - database queries
        │ - grep, create            │ - API calls
        │                           │ - deployment
        │                           │ - custom workflows
```

### ✅ Checkpoint
You understand MCP concepts, architecture, and security model.

---

## Exercise 7: Configuring MCP Servers

### Goal
Configure an MCP server for Copilot CLI to extend its capabilities.

### Steps

**7.1** Check what MCP configuration exists:

```
Is there any existing MCP configuration in this project?
Check .github/copilot/ and any mcp-related config files.
```

**7.2** Explore Copilot CLI's MCP support:

```
What command do I use to see available MCP servers?
How do I configure a new one?
```

**7.3** Create an MCP configuration file:

```
Create a .github/copilot/mcp.json configuration file.
Start with the GitHub MCP server that provides issue and PR tools.
```

> 💡 The configuration file tells Copilot CLI which MCP servers to connect to and how.

> 💡 **Recommended approach (v1.0.12):** Use `.mcp.json` at your git repository root — it's the simplest configuration location. Other options (`.github/copilot/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`) also work but are more verbose paths. Use those only if your organization requires a specific location.

**7.4** Understand the configuration format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "path/to/server",
      "args": ["--flag"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**7.5** Consider project-specific MCP servers:

```
For this Event API project, what MCP servers would be most valuable?
Think about:
- Database access (query the schema)
- OpenAPI spec (generate client code)
- Deployment (check environments)
```

**7.6** Security best practices:

```
What are the security best practices for MCP server configuration?
- Where should API keys go?
- Should MCP config be committed to git?
- How to scope MCP server permissions?
```

### Key Concept: MCP Configuration Levels

| Level | File Location | Scope |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Project | `.github/copilot/mcp.json` | All contributors to this repo |
| Workspace | `.vscode/mcp.json` | Workspace-local alternative (v0.0.407+) |
| Dev Container | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` | Codespaces / Dev Containers (v1.0.3+) |
| User | `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` | All your repos |

> 💡 **Reload without restarting (v0.0.412+):** After editing MCP configuration, run `/mcp reload` to apply changes without exiting your session.

> 💡 **Conversational MCP setup (v1.0.4):** Instead of manually editing config files, you can ask Copilot to configure MCP servers for you using the `configure-copilot` sub-agent — just describe what you need in natural language and it will manage the configuration via the task tool. For example: *"Add the GitHub MCP server to my project."*

> 💡 **Instruction visibility (v1.0.4):** The `/instructions` command now shows individual file names with `[external]` labels, making it easy to see exactly which instruction files are loaded and where they come from.

> 💡 **New config location (v1.0.12):** Place `.mcp.json` at your git root for the simplest MCP configuration. This is an alternative to `.github/copilot/mcp.json` and `.vscode/mcp.json`.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can configure MCP servers and understand security best practices.

---

## Exercise 8: Session Management

### Goal
Master Copilot CLI session management — resume, continue, and manage conversation history.

### Steps

**8.1** Check current session:

```
/context
```

> This shows what's currently loaded in the session.

**8.2** Exit and continue:

```
exit
```

Then restart with:

```bash
copilot --continue
```

> Your conversation history and context are preserved.

**8.3** Start a fresh session:

```bash
copilot
```

> This creates a new session with no history.

**8.4** Resume a specific previous session:

```bash
copilot --resume
```

> This shows a list of recent sessions to choose from.

**8.5** Understand session strategies:

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `--continue` | Picking up where you left off (same task) |
| `--resume` | Returning to an older session |
| New session | Starting a completely different task |
| `/clear` | Reset context within current session (preserves agent mode since v0.0.412) |
| `/restart` | Hot-restart CLI while preserving session (v1.0.3+) |

**8.6** Practice context management within a session:

```
@ src/services/eventService.ts
@ src/models/event.ts

Now I want to work on routes instead.

/clear

@ src/routes/events.ts
@ src/middleware/validation.ts
```

> `/clear` resets the context so you're not carrying service file context into route work. Since v0.0.412, `/clear` preserves your current agent mode (interactive/plan/autopilot) so you don't need to re-select it.

> 💡 **Persistent directories (v1.0.3):** Directories added with `/add-dir` now persist across `/clear` and `/resume`, so you don't lose your project scope when resetting conversation context. Use `/restart` to hot-restart the CLI (e.g., after an update) while preserving your current session — no need to exit and re-launch.

> 💡 **New session commands (v1.0.13):**
> - **`/rewind`** — Undo your last conversation turn AND revert all file changes from that turn
> - **`/new`** — Start a completely fresh conversation while keeping settings and environment
> - **`/session`** — View session metadata, rename sessions, and manage session lifecycle
> - **`/quit`** — Exit alias (joins `/exit` and `Ctrl+C`)

> 💡 **Persistent permissions (v1.0.12):** `/yolo` and `/allow-all` permissions now persist after `/clear`, so you don't lose your permission settings when resetting conversation context.

### Key Concept: Session Lifecycle

```
New session → Load context → Work → Exit
                                      │
                              ┌───────┴───────┐
                              │               │
                        --continue      --resume
                        (same task)    (pick session)
```

### ✅ Checkpoint
You can manage sessions effectively — continue, resume, clear, and start fresh.

---

## Exercise 9: Terminal Setup & Shell Integration

### Goal
Optimize your terminal for the best Copilot CLI experience.

### Steps

**9.1** Run terminal setup:

```
/terminal-setup
```

> This configures your shell for optimal Copilot integration, including multiline input.

**9.2** Test multiline input:

After terminal setup, try typing with Shift+Enter for new lines:

```
Create a function that:
- Takes an event ID
- Checks if it exists
- Returns the attendee count
```

> With terminal setup, each line is entered on a separate line in the prompt.

**9.3** Check shell integration features:

```
What shell integration features are available after /terminal-setup?
- Multiline input?
- Command history?
- Auto-completion?
```

**9.4** Customize your shell prompt (optional):

```
Can I add Copilot session info to my shell prompt?
Show me how to display the current session name.
```

**9.5** Keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift+Enter` | New line (after terminal setup) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current generation |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit Copilot |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate prompt history |

> 💡 **Adaptive themes (v1.0.4+):** The `/theme` command now offers an interactive picker with GitHub Dark, GitHub Light, and Auto modes. Themes adapt to your terminal's color scheme, and v1.0.7 improved color contrast for better readability.

> 💡 **Clickable links (v1.0.12):** If you use VS Code's terminal, OSC 8 hyperlinks are now clickable — URLs in Copilot's output can be clicked to open in your browser.

### ✅ Checkpoint
Your terminal is optimized for Copilot CLI with multiline input and shell integration.

---

## Exercise 10: Multi-Project Context

### Goal
Learn strategies for working with Copilot across multiple projects or monorepo modules.

### Steps

**10.1** Understand context boundaries:

```
If I'm in the sample-app/ directory, can Copilot see files 
in the parent directory (workshop/level-7/)?
What about sibling directories?
```

**10.2** Practice cross-directory references:

```
@ ../level-6/sample-app/shortener/store.py

Compare the storage approach in Level 6 (Python, JSON file) 
with our Level 7 approach (TypeScript, in-memory Map).
```

**10.3** Working with monorepo patterns:

```
If this project had a monorepo structure:
  packages/
    api/         ← our event API
    web/         ← React frontend
    shared/      ← shared types

How would I configure Copilot to understand the boundaries?
What should .copilotignore look like?
What should copilot-instructions.md cover?
```

**10.4** Context isolation strategies:

| Strategy | How | When |
|----------|-----|------|
| **cd into module** | `cd packages/api` | Working on one module only |
| **@ specific files** | `@ packages/shared/types.ts` | Pulling in shared types |
| **Instructions per module** | Separate `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Different conventions per module |
| **`.copilotignore`** | Exclude other modules' src | Keep context focused |

**10.5** Practice optimal context for cross-module work:

```
I need to add a new event type in shared/ and use it in both api/ and web/.
What's the most efficient way to do this in one Copilot session?
```

### ✅ Checkpoint
You understand context boundaries and strategies for multi-project work.

## Exercise 11: Instruction Layering

### Goal
Understand how instructions from different levels combine and override each other.

### Steps

**11.1** Understand the instruction hierarchy:

```
What are the different levels of Copilot instructions?
How do they layer together?
Which ones take priority?
```

**11.2** Explore each level:

> 💡 **Simplified model (the essentials):** These are the five most common instruction sources you'll encounter in daily work:

| Level | Location | Scope | Example |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Organization** | GitHub org settings | All repos in org | "Always use Python 3.12+" |
| **Repository** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | This repo | "Use AppError for errors" |
| **User (cross-repo)** | `~/.copilot/instructions/*.instructions.md` | All your repos (v0.0.412+) | "Always add JSDoc comments" |
| **Personal** | `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` | Your sessions only | "Explain changes before making them" |
| **Session** | Conversation context | Current session | "Focus on performance" |

**11.3** Create personal instructions:

```
What would good personal instructions look like?
Things I always want Copilot to do, regardless of project:
- Always explain what you're going to change before changing it
- Prefer small, incremental changes
- Always suggest running tests after modifications
```

**11.4** Test instruction layering:

```
If my repository instructions say "use AppError" but my personal 
instructions say "always add JSDoc comments", will both be followed?
What if they conflict?
```

**11.5** Best practices for instruction layering:

| Level | What to Put Here |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Organization** | Language versions, security policies, universal style |
| **Repository** | Project-specific conventions, architecture rules, framework patterns |
| **Personal** | Communication preferences, verbosity level, workflow habits |
| **Session** | Task-specific constraints ("focus on performance", "no external deps") |

### Key Concept: Instruction Priority

```
Session context (highest priority)
    ↓
Personal instructions
    ↓
User cross-repo instructions (~/.copilot/instructions/)
    ↓
Repository instructions
    ↓
Organization instructions (lowest priority)
```

> 💡 More specific instructions override more general ones. Session-level "ignore previous instruction X" can override repository defaults.

> 💡 **Dynamic instruction retrieval (v1.0.5, experimental):** Copilot can now use embedding-based relevance matching to dynamically select which MCP and skill instructions to inject per turn. Instead of loading all instructions every time, it retrieves only the ones relevant to the current prompt — improving context efficiency as your instruction set grows.

> 💡 **Complete instruction hierarchy (v1.0.13):**
>
> The simplified model above covers the most common sources. The full picture includes additional cross-tool files and environment variables. All sources are **aggregated** (they combine, not override):
>
> | Priority | Source | Scope |
> |----------|--------|-------|
> | 1 (lowest) | Organization settings | All repos in org |
> | 2 | `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` | All your projects |
> | 3 | `~/.copilot/instructions/*.instructions.md` | All your projects (modular, v0.0.412+) |
> | 4 | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | This repository |
> | 5 | `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` | Path-matched files in this repo |
> | 6 | `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` / `AGENTS.md` | This repository (cross-tool, v1.0.13) |
> | 7 | `.claude/settings.json` | This repository (cross-tool config, v1.0.12) |
> | 8 | `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` env var | Directories specified by env var (v1.0.13) |
> | 9 (highest) | Session context | Current conversation |
>
> Use `/instructions` to see which files are currently loaded and toggle them on/off.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You understand instruction layering and can configure at each level appropriately.

## Exercise 12: Configuration Audit

### Goal
Audit your complete Copilot CLI configuration and measure its effectiveness.

### Steps

**12.1** Inventory all configuration:

```
List all Copilot-related configuration in this project:
- .github/copilot-instructions.md
- .copilotignore
- MCP configuration
- Any other copilot config files
```

**12.2** Test each configuration component:

| Component | Test | Pass? |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Instructions** | Generate a service function — follows conventions? | |
| **Instructions** | Generate a test — uses describe/it, not test()? | |
| **Instructions** | Generate error handling — uses AppError? | |
| **`.copilotignore`** | Try `@ generated/openapi.json` — excluded? | |
| **Context targeting** | Service task with only service+model `@` — works? | |

**12.3** Measure before/after quality:

```
Without loading custom instructions, generate a new service function.
Then, with instructions loaded, generate the same function.
Compare the quality of both outputs.
```

**12.4** Identify remaining gaps:

```
Review the .github/copilot-instructions.md. 
Are there any conventions in the codebase that aren't captured?
Scan the codebase for patterns that should be documented.
```

> 💡 **CLI Extensions (experimental, v1.0.3+):** Copilot CLI supports extensions — custom tools and hooks built with `@github/copilot-sdk`. Since v1.0.5, you can manage them with the `/extensions` command to view, enable, or disable installed extensions. As extensions mature, they'll become a powerful way to tailor Copilot's capabilities to your team's specific workflows.

**12.5** Create an optimization checklist for future projects:

```
Based on everything we configured, create a checklist for 
setting up Copilot in a new project:
1. Create .github/copilot-instructions.md with: [...]
2. Create .copilotignore with: [...]
3. Set up MCP servers for: [...]
4. Create prompt templates for: [...]
5. Configure session preferences: [...]
```

**12.6** Share with your team:

```
Write a short guide (5 bullet points) for teammates who haven't 
configured Copilot yet. What's the highest-impact configuration 
they should do first?
```

### Key Concept: Configuration ROI

| Configuration | Setup Time | Impact |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Custom instructions** | 15 min | 🔴 High — every generation follows conventions |
| **`.copilotignore`** | 5 min | 🟡 Medium — cleaner context, fewer distractions |
| **Prompt templates** | 10 min | 🟡 Medium — consistent quality across team |
| **MCP servers** | 20 min | 🟢 Variable — depends on project needs |
| **Terminal setup** | 2 min | 🟢 Low but nice — multiline input |

> 💡 **Custom instructions are the highest-ROI configuration.** 15 minutes of setup saves hours of correcting convention violations.

### ✅ Checkpoint
You've audited your configuration, measured its effectiveness, and created a reusable setup checklist.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Custom instructions are the #1 optimization** — 15 min setup, hours saved
2. **Test instructions with real generation** — don't assume they work, verify
3. **Context is a budget** — load exactly what's needed, no more
4. **`.copilotignore` prevents noise** — exclude generated, compiled, and vendor files
5. **Prompt templates standardize quality** — share them with your team
6. **MCP servers extend capabilities** — database, APIs, deployment tools
7. **Sessions have a lifecycle** — continue, resume, clear, restart
8. **Terminal setup enables multiline** — `/terminal-setup` once, benefit forever
9. **Instructions layer from general to specific** — org → repo → personal → session
10. **Audit regularly** — conventions change, instructions should follow
