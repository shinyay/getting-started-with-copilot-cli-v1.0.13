# Workshop Learner Onboarding

Help learners verify their environment and choose the right starting point for the Copilot CLI workshop.

## Environment Verification

Check these prerequisites and report a status table:

### Required Tools

| Tool | Required For | Minimum Version | Check Command |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | All levels | 2.x | `gh --version` |
| Copilot CLI | All levels | Any | `copilot --version` |
| Python | Levels 1–6 | 3.8+ | `python3 --version` |
| Git | All levels | 2.x | `git --version` |

### Optional Tools

| Tool | Required For | Check Command |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Node.js 18+ | Level 7 only | `node --version` |
| npm | Level 7 only | `npm --version` |

### Authentication

Run `gh auth status` to verify:
- GitHub authentication is active
- Copilot access is available (requires Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise)

## Choosing a Starting Level

Based on the learner's experience, recommend a starting level:

| Experience Level | Start At | Rationale |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| **New to Copilot entirely** | Level 1 | Build foundation from zero risk |
| **Used Copilot in IDE, new to CLI** | Level 1 (skim) → Level 3 | Familiar with AI assist, need CLI-specific skills |
| **Basic CLI experience** | Level 4 or 5 | Ready for write operations and command execution |
| **Want to optimize workflow** | Level 7 | Focus on customization and configuration |
| **Need automation/delegation** | Level 8 | Advanced permissions and agent delegation |
| **Want to build extensions** | Level 9 | Extension development, skills, MCP customization |

## Workshop Structure Overview

- **108 exercises** across 9 levels (12 per level)
- **Estimated time**: 9–13 hours total (1–2 hours per level)
- **Each level has**: README.md (exercises), CHEATSHEET.md (quick reference), sample-app/ (hands-on code)
- **Safety**: Levels 1–3 are read-only (no risk). Level 4+ involves file modifications.
- **Reset**: `git checkout workshop/level-N/sample-app/` restores any level's app to original state

## Quick Smoke Test

After setup, verify Copilot CLI works:

```bash
# Start Copilot CLI in the repo directory
copilot

# Then ask:
# "What is this repository about? List the workshop levels."
```

If Copilot responds with information about the 9-level learning path, the setup is complete.

## Curriculum Map

```
Level 1: Observe    → Read files, navigate, understand safety gates
Level 2: Understand → Ask questions, trace architecture, get explanations
Level 3: Plan       → Create implementation plans, evaluate approaches
Level 4: Create     → Make first changes, approve edits, use /diff and /review
Level 5: Execute    → Run tests, fix failures, lint, TDD workflow
Level 6: Workflow   → Full Plan→Execute→Review cycles, complete SDLC
Level 7: Customize  → Custom instructions, MCP, context optimization
Level 8: Advanced   → Permissions, sessions, automation, Coding Agent delegation
Level 9: Extend     → Extensions, skills, CLAUDE.md, MCP server configuration
```
